              , this project was one of my first encounters with programming
              during university.

              It simulates the flocking behavior of autonomous agents (boids)
              using HTML5 Canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The boids follow simple rules like separation, alignment, and
              cohesion, but together they create mesmerizing and complex
              movement patterns.

              <strong>Throwback to a classic!</strong> This Simon Says game was
              built over 5 years ago using HTML5 Canvas and is a digital take on
              the iconic memory game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Players must follow an increasingly complex sequence of flashing
              colors and sounds, testing their memory and reflexes.
            </p>

              It may be an older project, but it‚Äôs still fun ‚Äî though it&#39;s
              about time I gave it a bit of love and attention.

              This project was part of a tech assignment, but it&#39;s a neat
              addition to my portfolio!
            </p>
            <p>
              Built over a year ago using React, it&#39;s a poker simulation
              where all the cards are drawn and evaluated immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              While not overly complex, the game still captures the excitement
              of poker, providing instant results and insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#39;s a simple yet fun way to see poker hands play out, and
              definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys quick simulations!
