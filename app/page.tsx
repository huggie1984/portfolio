                  With 10 years in the world of web development, I‚Äôm all about
                  the endless creativity and freedom that come with building
                  awesome web apps! I have a blast working with cutting-edge
                  tech like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>,
                  whipping up fast, dynamic UIs that keep things exciting. Over
                  the years, I‚Äôve mastered the art of tackling tricky, complex
                  interfaces‚Äîearning some serious kudos for my speed and
                  top-notch quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I‚Äôm also a fan of automation and enjoy writing Node.js scripts
                  to simplify development workflows and automate repetitive
                  tasks, making day-to-day development more efficient.

                  Currently, I‚Äôm diving deeper into AWS and enjoying the
                  learning journey, with some exposure to backend libraries like
                  Java and Ruby, and I‚Äôm excited to expand my knowledge further.

                  people and culture‚Äîone where I can work with other talented
                  individuals to continue growing and learning. Ideally, I‚Äôm
                  seeking the flexibility of hybrid working, with 2 days in the
                  office and the freedom to work in the EU from time to time.

              It simulates the flocking behavior of autonomous agents (boids)
              using HTML5 Canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The boids follow simple rules like separation, alignment, and
              cohesion, but together they create mesmerizing and complex
              movement patterns.

              <strong>Throwback to a classic!</strong> This Simon Says game was
              built over 5 years ago using HTML5 Canvas and is a digital take on
              the iconic memory game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Players must follow an increasingly complex sequence of flashing
              colors and sounds, testing their memory and reflexes.

              It may be an older project, but it‚Äôs still fun ‚Äî though it&#39;s

              This project was part of a tech assignment, but it&#39;s a neat
              addition to my portfolio!
            </p>
            <p>
              Built over a year ago using React, it&#39;s a poker simulation
              where all the cards are drawn and evaluated immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              While not overly complex, the game still captures the excitement
              of poker, providing instant results and insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#39;s a simple yet fun way to see poker hands play out, and
              definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys quick simulations!
