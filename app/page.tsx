            <strong>Welcome to my playground!</strong> Some of the projects
            below are relics from my earlier days, so don&#39;t be surprised if
            you stumble upon a bit of nostalgia. I’m in the process of giving
            them a modern makeover as tech continues to evolve—just like me!
          </p>
          <p>
            With 10 years in the world of web development, I’m all about the
            endless creativity and freedom that come with building awesome web
            apps! I have a blast working with cutting-edge tech like{' '}
            <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, whipping up
            fast, dynamic UIs that keep things exciting. Over the years, I’ve
            mastered the art of tackling tricky, complex interfaces—earning some
            serious kudos for my speed and top-notch quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also a fan of automation and enjoy writing Node.js scripts to
            simplify development workflows and automate repetitive tasks, making
            day-to-day development more efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I’m diving deeper into AWS and enjoying the learning
            journey, with some exposure to backend libraries like Java and Ruby,
            and I’m excited to expand my knowledge further.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m on the lookout for a company that prides itself on its people
            and culture—one where I can work with other talented individuals to
            continue growing and learning. Ideally, I’m seeking the flexibility
            of hybrid working, with 2 days in the office and the freedom to work
            in the EU from time to time.

                <strong>AI Flocking Simulation</strong> Inspired by

                  Craig Reynolds&#39; &#34;Boids&#34; model
                </a>
                , this project was one of my first encounters with programming
                during university.
              </p>
              <p>
                It simulates the flocking behavior of autonomous agents (boids)
                using HTML5 Canvas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The boids follow simple rules like separation, alignment, and
                cohesion, but together they create mesmerizing and complex
                movement patterns.
              </p>

                Now, after years of letting these digital birds fly as they are,
                I&#39;m planning an update. Get ready as I improve their
                behavior, making them smarter and maybe a bit sassier too!

              <strong>Throwback to a classic!</strong> This Simon Says game was
              built over 5 years ago using HTML5 Canvas and is a digital take on
              the iconic memory game. Players must follow an increasingly
              complex sequence of flashing colors and sounds, testing their
              memory and reflexes. It may be an older project, but it’s still
              fun — though it&#39;s about time I gave it a bit of love and
              attention.

            <p>
              This project was part of a tech assignment, but it&#39;s a neat
              addition to my portfolio!
            </p>
            <p>
              Built over a year ago using React, it&#39;s a poker simulation
              where all the cards are drawn and evaluated immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              While not overly complex, the game still captures the excitement
              of poker, providing instant results and insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#39;s a simple yet fun way to see poker hands play out, and
              definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys quick simulations!
